<h2> Tic-Tac-Toe </h2>

This tic-tac-toe program was based off of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/linux/nexusone/projects.html" target="_blank">Nate Robin's project</a>
at his <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/linux/nexusone/index.html" target="_blank">angelfire site</a>.

I added three difficulty levels, a basic menu, and reduced the game to only 2D. 

To compile, I recommend using Visual Studio 2010, with the proper OpenGLUT Environment Paths set. 
The project settings I used to compile, run and debug the program are included.
